# IdleFarmerRPG ðŸšœðŸŒ½
IdleFarmerRPG (IFRPG) is a text-based role playing game written in Python, centered around managing a farm.

The inspiration behind this game stems from my like of various things:
- Farming Games
- Idle Games
- Role Playing Games
- and Python!

So, I decided to mash everything up and IdleFarmerRPG was born!

I deciced to create this project to display my Python code writing skills:
- Decision Making
- Menu Navigation
- Working With Files

One of the challenges I set for myself for this project was to write the whole thing in pure Python. Meaning no additional packages were used or installed. For example, when displaying the fields table I could have made coding easier by using PrettyTable but instead I used print statements.

# Changelog
## Version 0.1.0
This version is the first public release of the game. The game is no where near complete but, I have enough of a structure built at this point that it should make adding functionality and features much easier.

# Future Goals
The game is no where near complete, there are a few bugs especially with user input, the game expects a number if a user inputs a character the game will crash. So, in the future I need to fix that. Additionally, one of the biggest features I would like to add is an in game shop to add another layer of gameplay. I would like to also add more animals and more in depth functionality to the fields.
